When using a new version of upbge, the build python folder needs to be replaced with the modified version (from a previous version)
When installing a new module, the local pip in the python folder needs to be used, like this : 
./bin/pip3 install --target lib/python3.9 pyzmq


// How to run blenderplayer from blender.exe :

import bpy
bpy.ops.wm.blenderplayer_start()

// Headless build is created by commenting out all instances of
XMapWindow(... on Linux
and insert 
::ShowWindow(m_hWnd, SW_HIDE); 
after SetWindowPos calls in GHOST_WindowWin32.cpp on Windows

// Efficient ImageViewport.refresh() is achieved by modifying
upbge-master/upbge/source/gameengine/VideoTexture/ImageViewport.cpp
// calcViewport()
// and replacing the last else with 

glReadPixels(m_upLeft[0],
       m_upLeft[1],
       (GLsizei)m_capSize[0],
       (GLsizei)m_capSize[1],
       GL_RGBA,
       GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE,
       m_image);
m_avail = true;
if (format == GL_BGRA) 
	swapImageBR();

// This will remove an expensive cpu bound iteration over all pixels
