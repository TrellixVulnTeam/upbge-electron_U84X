When using a new version of upbge, the build python folder needs to be replaced with the modified version (from a previous version)
When installing a new module, the local pip in the python folder needs to be used, like this : 
./bin/pip3 install --target lib/python3.9 pyzmq


import bpy
bpy.ops.wm.blenderplayer_start()

// Headless is created by commenting out all instances of
XMapWindow(... on Linux
and 
??? on Windows

// Efficient ImageViewport.refresh() is achieved by modifying
/home/sven/Desktop/hobby_projects/upbge_cultivation/upbge-master/upbge/source/gameengine/VideoTexture/ImageViewport.cpp
calcViewport()
and replacing the last else with 
glReadPixels(m_upLeft[0],
       m_upLeft[1],
       (GLsizei)m_capSize[0],
       (GLsizei)m_capSize[1],
       GL_RGBA,
       GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE,
       m_image);
m_avail = true;
if (format == GL_BGRA) 
	swapImageBR();
